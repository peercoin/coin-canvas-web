This has been taken from
[@pronestor/react-zoom-pan-pinch](https://github.com/proNestorAps/react-zoom-pan-pinch)
so that it can be modified to meet the requirements of Coin Canvas and to avoid
needlessly bundling with rollup when webpack is already being used. In
particular, the ability to zoom centred around the cursor has been added.
