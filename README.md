# Coin Canvas Web

The code requires `coin-canvas-lib` to exist in the same parent directory and
this library must be built beforehand.

Before the website can be run or built, it needs to be configured with a file at
`src/config.ts`. An example configuration is provided as
`src/config.example.ts`. This example configuration will operate the site using
the regtest development environment from `coin-canvas-integration`.

`npm start` can be used to run a development server or the site can be built
using `npm run build`.
